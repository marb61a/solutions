These are the solutions to the Krypton set of challenges from overthewire. The challenges are cryptography
based so that will mean learning at least a few things about the area.

Level 0 - 
As to be expected there is a simple challenge to get started, the challenge is to decode a string using base64 to
encode. There are many different ways to decode using a base64 decoder, online or even a python script like this

import base64  
cipher = "S1JZUFRPTklTR1JFQVQ="  
print base64.decodestring(cipher).

This is a basic challenge but learning about base64 should be a good place to start.
