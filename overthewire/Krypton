These are the solutions to the Krypton set of challenges from overthewire. The challenges are cryptography
based so that will mean learning at least a few things about the area.

Level 0 - 
As to be expected there is a simple challenge to get started, the challenge is to decode a string using base64 to
encode. There are many different ways to decode using a base64 decoder, online or even a python script like this

import base64  
cipher = "S1JZUFRPTklTR1JFQVQ="  
print base64.decodestring(cipher).

This is a basic challenge but learning about base64 should be a good place to start.




Level 1 - 
When you log into this level you will find 2 files located in the krypton1 directory called README and krypton2. If
you cat the readme file you will get the following text 
Welcome to Krypton!
 
This game is intended to give hands on experience with cryptography
and cryptanalysis.  The levels progress from classic ciphers, to modern,
easy to harder.
 
Although there are excellent public tools, like cryptool,to perform
the simple analysis, we strongly encourage you to try and do these
without them for now.  We will use them in later excercises.
 
** Please try these levels without cryptool first **
 
The first level is easy.  The password for level 2 is in the file
'krypton2'.  It is 'encrypted' using a simple rotation called ROT13.
It is also in non-standard ciphertext format.  When using alpha characters for
cipher text it is normal to group the letters into 5 letter clusters,
regardless of word boundaries.  This helps obfuscate any patterns.
 
This file has kept the plain text word boundaries and carried them to
the cipher text.
 
Enjoy!

If you then cat the krypton2 file you will get an encoded password. There are several different ways of decoding
this including building your own and using online decoders. This is a fairly simple challenge as the type of 
encoding is told in the readme file.
