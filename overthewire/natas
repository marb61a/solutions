These are the solutions for the natas game on overthewire. Natas is mostly about web security.

Level 0 - 
You are given the username and password for this level however you need to find the password which is on the page. The
solution is quite straight forward. Right click and select view source and you will see the password.

Level 1 - 
This is the same as previous but the right click has been disabled. In most browsers ctrl+u will bring up
the view source page so another quick solution.

Level 2 -
This is similar to the previous challenges as we have to find a password. The hint given is that there is nothing on 
this page. When you examine the page source code there is a directory called /files, the contents are two files in 
the directory listing. One of these files was called users.txt and when looking at the contents of the file both the 
username and password for natas3 are there.

Level 3 -
This is very similar to the previous challenge especially since the hint that is given is the exact same. When the 
page source code is opened it reveals a lot as it tells you that not even Google will find the information, this means
that there is a robot.txt file present which will prevent search engines from seeing certain directories. If we then
navigate to the robots.txt file there is a directory called /s3cr3t/ which disallows google but allows us to navigate.
Inside this directory is a file called users.txt and it contains the information we need.
