These are the solutions for the OverTheWire Leviathan Wargame.

Level 0 - This involves just using the user name and password in order to ssh connect to the overthewire labs



Level 0-1 - The first challenge involves finding a password. As on other challenges it does well to remember that
finetuning commands gives better visibility on what is around. With this in mind the solution is

ls -la - This shows a hidden directory (hidden entities have a dot in front of them) called .backup,
cd .backup - going into the directory  
ls -la - shows that there is a file called bookmarks.html
cat bookmarks.html | grep password - will search the file for the password.




Level 1-2 - In this challenge there is a file named check, when you run a password that is wrong against the file it 
exits. As there is little or no information other than this, there will have to be some tests run against the file, 
there is a good guide to the debugging tools available on linux at

The solution will need to be explained step by step
Running ltrace ./check will trace the calls to the library function, this is a very well used linux tool and the main
reason that it is needed in this instance is that the password is stored within the file which means that We need to 
trace the.
The result of the ltrace gives some interesting results not least the fact that strcmp is running comparing the 
password entered to the word sex.
This means that running the file again using ./check and entering the word sex will give a shell.
Running the whoami command to see who you are gives leviathan2
Finally running cat against the file /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan2 will give the password
