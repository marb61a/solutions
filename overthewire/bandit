Bandit Solutions

Level 0 -
Simply ssh to bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org using the password bandit0 and you are in the shell.

Level 1 -
Use ls to see files
Use the cat command with filename to read the file and grab the password.

Level 2 -
According to the challenge there is a file called “-” in the home directory and it contains the password
needed to get to the next level. The solution again is fairly simple, use the absolute path to get to the
file, in this case the following works
cat ./-

Level 3 -
This time the challenge is to read a file with spaces in it’s name, the simple way of doing this is to
surround the filename with quotes like this
cat "spaces in this filename"
There is als0 another way which is a bit more complicated is this
cat ./spaces\ in\ this\ filename
where you use escape characters.

Level 4 -
This time the challenge is to find the password for the next level which is stored in a hidden file in the 
inhere directory. Again this is fairly easy 
using ls gives a listing but not of hidden files, -a is needed to see hidden files so
ls -la
and then there are a couple of options
cat ./inhere/.hidden
cat .hidden
which are dependent on where you are in the file tree.
