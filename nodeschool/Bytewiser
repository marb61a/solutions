These are my solutions to the Nodeschool Bytewiser set of challanges.

Level 1  Buffer From String -
This is a simple challenge to get started which is to  write a node program that prints a buffer object containing
the string "bytewiser" using console.log. The solution is fairly obvious 

console.log(new Buffer("bytewiser"));


Level 2 Hexadecimal Encoding -
This challange according to the site itself asks that given an unknown number of bytes passed via process.argv, 
create a buffer from them and output a hexadecimal encoded representation of the buffer. The answer should be a string
of two-character pairs (also known as hexadecimal octets), where each pair represents a single number in the array of 
bytes converted to hexadecimal. My solution is pretty much the same as the official one, it looks like this

var bytes = process.argv.slice(2).map(parseFloat)
console.log(new Buffer(bytes).toString('hex'))

I did try using parseInt instead of parseFloat but it only worked for one test, also number can be used instead of
paresFloat.
