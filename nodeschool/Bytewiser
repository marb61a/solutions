These are my solutions to the Nodeschool Bytewiser set of challanges.

Level 1  Buffer From String -
This is a simple challenge to get started which is to  write a node program that prints a buffer object containing
the string "bytewiser" using console.log. The solution is fairly obvious 

console.log(new Buffer("bytewiser"));
