These are my solutions to the Nodeschool Make Me Hapi series of challenges. Hapi is a framework for Node and it is
like Express in that both are Http frameworks.

Level 1 - Hello Hapi
This is the first challeng in the makemehapi set and according to the sitewe must create a hapi server that listens 
on a port passed from the command line and replies with "Hello Hapi" when an HTTP GET request is sent to /. There is 
a large amount of hints and boilerplate code so the solution should be relatively straight forward

var Hapi = require('hapi');
var server = new Hapi.Server();
var portNum = process.argv[2];

server.connection({host: 'localhost', port: Number(portNum || 8080)});

server.route({
                path : '/', 
                method:'GET',
                handler: function(req, reply)
                        {
                            reply('Hello Hapi');
                            
                        }});
                        
server.start();

There were some issues with my cloud ide as I had not installed hapi so that is important as is the need to make 
sure that the localhost address is correct as it may need to be changed depending on the ide.
