These are my solutions to the Nodeschool Browserify series of challenges

Level 1  BEEP BOOP - 
The first task as is standard across all of the nodeschool series of challenges is a simple one in this case it is
simply to print BEEP BOOP to the console using console.log().

console.log('BEEP BOOP');



Level 2 Using NPM Packages -
This second task is also fairly basic as the documentation asks that 
For this level, use `prompt()` to fetch a string. Split the string that
`prompt()` returns by commas (`str.split(',')` returns a separated array of
strings) and run this array through `uniq()` to discard repeated items.
Use `console.log()` to print the resulting uniq array.
The solution is - 
var uniq = require("uniq");
var str = prompt();

console.log(uniq(str.split(',')));
