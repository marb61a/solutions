These are the solutions to the count-to-six set of challenges

Level 1 - 
As expected the first challenge is basic -
Just to make sure everything is working, write a program.js that outputs the string "HELLO ES6" to the console. The
solution is of course -

console.log("HELLO ES6");

Level 2 Template Strings - 
This is the second challenge and this time the task is the following -
You will be given a name as the first argument to your program (process.argv[2]). You should output a two-line message
, first greeting that person, and then telling them their name in lowercase. For example, if the name was "Domenic", 
you would output:

    Hello, Domenic!
    Your name lowercased is "domenic".

You can start by doing this using ES5 constructs if you like, but the correct solution should use a single ES6 
template string, and not use the + operator.
The solution using ES6 looks a bit different than standard ES5 code -

var name = process.argv[2];
console.log(`Hello, ${name}!
Your name lowercased is "${name.toLowerCase()}".`);
