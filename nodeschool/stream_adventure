These are my solutions to Nodeschool Stream Adventure

Level 01  Beep Boop -
This is a simple challenge to get started, write a program the outpus beep boop to the console
console.log('beep boop');

Level 02  Meet Pipe -
var fs = require("fs");
var fileNeeded = process.argv[2];

fs.createReadStream(fileNeeded).pipe(process.stdout);

There are various combinations of the above for solving the problem but this is mine.

Level 03 - The challenge is to take data from `process.stdin` and pipe it to `process.stdout`. The documentation
also warns against overthinking the problem. The solution itself is fairly easy

process.stdin.pipe(process.stdout);
