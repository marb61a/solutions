These are my solutions to Nodeschool Stream Adventure

Level 01  Beep Boop -
This is a simple challenge to get started, write a program the outpus beep boop to the console
console.log('beep boop');

Level 02  Meet Pipe -
var fs = require("fs");
var fileNeeded = process.argv[2];

fs.createReadStream(fileNeeded).pipe(process.stdout);

There are various combinations of the above for solving the problem but this is mine.

Level 03 Input Output -
The challenge is to take data from `process.stdin` and pipe it to `process.stdout`. The documentation
also warns against overthinking the problem. The solution itself is fairly easy

process.stdin.pipe(process.stdout);

Level 04 Transform -
This time the challenge is to create a through stream with a `write` and `end` function. As with all of these
challenges each level builds on the previous and usually combining this with the hints get you close to solving the
challenge, with this in mind the solution is

var through = require("through");
var transformStream = through (function(buffer){
    this.queue(buffer.toString().toUpperCase());
});    

process.stdin.pipe(transformStream).pipe(process.stdout);

One note is that the official solution has through2 as a variable but for some reason that solution does not work 
for me ????

Level 05 Lines -
In the fifth challenge we are asked to write a solution to a challenge which is identical to the previous one but
with one important twist which is to convert even-numbered lines to upper-case and odd-numbered lines to lower-case.
We may also consider the first line to be odd-numbered. We also have to install split through2 to the directory. As
this is similar to the previous challeng we should be able to use a lot of the code and the documentation gives a
good hint as to where to proceed from, my solution is this

var through = require("through");
var split = require('split');
var newlines = 1;

var transformStream = through(function write(buffer){
    this.queue(buffer.toString()[
        newlines++ % 2 === 0? 'toUpperCase' : 'toLowerCase'
        ]() + '\n');
});
process.stdin.pipe(split()).pipe(transformStream).pipe(process.stdout);

As you can see I made use of the previous challenges code and also the hints, I was torn about using if else or a
ternary statement in combination with the modulus either one will do as will other methods.
