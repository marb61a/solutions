                        Tower of Babel
      These are my solutions to the Tower of Babel problem series from Nodeschool
                        
Level 1 Setup Babel -                        
The first challenge is to install babel properly and run a hello world like this 
  - npm install babel -g with the g option for global installation
  
Then to run the verification 
  - babel-node program15.js (as my program is program 15)
  



Level 2 Class -
The second challenge of the series asks for an ES6 compatible rewrite of some code provided, the code provided is
var Character = function(x, y) {
      this.x = x;
      this.y = y;
      this.health_ = 100;
    };
    
    Character.prototype.damage = function() {
      this.health_ = this.health_ - 10;
    };
    
    Character.prototype.getHealth = function() {
      return this.health_;
    };
    
    Character.prototype.toString = function() {
      return "x: " + this.x + " y: " + this.y + " health: " + this.getHealth();
    };

The solution is - 
class Character {
    
    constructor(x, y){
      this.x = x;
      this.y = y;
      this.health_ = 100;
    };
    
    damage() {
      this.health_ -=  10;
    };
    
    getHealth() {
      return this.health_;
    };
    
    toString() {
      return "x: " + this.x + " y: " + this.y + " health: " + this.health_;
    };
    }
    
var x = process.argv[2];
var y = process.argv[3];
var character = new Character(+x, +y);
character.damage();
console.log(character.toString());
