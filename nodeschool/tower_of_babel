                        Tower of Babel
      These are my solutions to the Tower of Babel problem series from Nodeschool
                        
Level 1 Setup Babel -                        
The first challenge is to install babel properly and run a hello world like this 
  - npm install babel -g with the g option for global installation
  
Then to run the verification 
  - babel-node program15.js (as my program is program 15)
