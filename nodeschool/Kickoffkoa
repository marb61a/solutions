These are solutions to the Kickoffkoa series of challenges 
*** Koa will not work on any Node version below 0.11.13


Level 1 Hello Koa -
As this is the first challenge of the series this should be a fairly basic challenge to ensure that all is working
for challenges further down the line. The official definition of the task is this -
Create a koa server that listens on a port passed from the command line and replies with "hello koa" when an 
HTTP GET request is sent to /.

The workshop will execute requests against the server and verify the output.
This will be easy as the hints give most if not all of the code needed so the solution will be -

var koa = require('koa');
var app = koa();
var port = process.argv[2];

app.use(function* (){
    this.body = 'hello koa';
});

app.listen(port);

Easy enough after reinstalling everything as node version was not high enough.
