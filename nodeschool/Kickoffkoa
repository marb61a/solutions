These are solutions to the Kickoffkoa series of challenges 
*** Koa will not work on any Node version below 0.11.13


Level 1 Hello Koa -
As this is the first challenge of the series this should be a fairly basic challenge to ensure that all is working
for challenges further down the line. The official definition of the task is this -
Create a koa server that listens on a port passed from the command line and replies with "hello koa" when an 
HTTP GET request is sent to /.

The workshop will execute requests against the server and verify the output.
This will be easy as the hints give most if not all of the code needed so the solution will be -

var koa = require('koa');
var app = koa();
var port = process.argv[2];

app.use(function* (){
    this.body = 'hello koa';
});

app.listen(port);

Easy enough after reinstalling everything as node version was not high enough.



Level 2 Routing -
The task for the second challege is as follows -
Create a koa server that listen on a port passed from the command line, and returns the following responses from 
the following routes:

    /    - hello koa
    /404 - page not found
    /500 - internal server error
There are plenty of hints available from the accompanying material so the solution should be quick enough and should
look like this :

var koa = require('koa');
var app = koa();
var port = process.argv[2];

app.use(function* (next){
    if (this.path !== '/') {
        return yield next;
    }
    
    this.body = 'hello koa';
});

app.use(function* (next){
    if (this.path !== '/404') {
        return yield next;
     }
     
     this.body = 'page not found';
});

app.use(function* (next){
    if (this.path !== '/500') {
        return yield next;
     }
     
     this.body = 'internal server error';
});

app.listen(port);
