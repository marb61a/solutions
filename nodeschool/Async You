These are the solutions to the Nodeschool Async You set of challenges

Level 1 Waterfall -
This is the first challenge and according to the documentation there is a need to write a program that first reads the
contents of a file.The path will be provided as the first command-line argument to your program and the file will 
contain a single URL. Using http.get, create a GET request to this URL and console.log the response body. This is a 
relatively basic challenge to start as there is a lot of code given so here is the solution 

var http = require('http')
var async = require("async");
var fs = require("fs");
var filepath = process.argv[2];

async.waterfall([
    function(cb){
        fs.readFile(filepath, function(err, data){
            if(err){
                return cb(err);
            }else{
                cb(null, data.toString());
            }
        });
    },
    function(urlData, cb){
        var body = '';
        http.get(urlData, function(res){
                res.on('data', function(chunk){
                body += chunk.toString();
            });
                res.on('end', function(){
                cb(null, body);
            });
        }).on('error', function(err) {
          cb(err);
        });
        }
    ], 
    function(err, result){
      if (err) return console.error(err);
      console.log(result);
    }
    );

This has a lot of the boilerplate code that was given used with a little amount of changes as that was all the 
challenge needed.
