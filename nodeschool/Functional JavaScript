These are my solutions to the Nodeschool Functional Javascript Challenges

Level 1 - Hello World -
As usual the first level is fairly easy which in this case is to take an input string and return it uppercased. This
is the solution although there are more ways to do the same.

module.exports = function upperCaser(input) {
      // SOLUTION GOES HERE
      return input.toUpperCase();
    };
