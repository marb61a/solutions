These are my solutions to the Nodeschool Functional Javascript Challenges

Level 01 Hello World -
As usual the first level is fairly easy which in this case is to take an input string and return it uppercased. This
is the solution although there are more ways to do the same.

module.exports = function upperCaser(input) {
     
      return input.toUpperCase();
    };



Level 02 - Higher Order Functions -
The second challenge is about how javascript handles functions particularly compared to other languages. You are asked
to implement a function that takes a function as its first argument, a number num as its second argument, then 
executes the passed in function num times. As before you are warned not to overthink the solution and again there is
boilerplate code provided. This is the solution I used

module.exports = function repeat (operation, num){
      if(num === 0){
            return;
      }
      operation();
      return repeat(operation, num -1);
};

There are other similar ways to solve this including assigning a variable to the function and then calling like this

function repeat (operation, num){
      if(num === 0){
            return;
      }
      operation();
      return repeat(operation, num -1);
}

module.exports = repeat;

Both of these and several others are equally valid.


Level 03 Basic Map -
In this challenge the task is to convert a for loop into an Array Map. There is as standard boilerplate code that
you must use. There are also 3 conditions that must be followed, Your solution should use Array.prototype.map(), do 
not use any for/while loops or Array.prototype.forEach and do not create any unecessary functions e.g. helpers. The
for loop itself basically multiplies the numbers that it gets by 2. The solution is this

function doubleAll(numbers) {
      return numbers.map(function(num){
            return num * 2;
      });
    }
    
module.exports = doubleAll;

Its easy enough to follow and shows the value of things like map.




Level 04 - Basic Filter
According to the documentation the challange on this level is to use Array#filter to write a function called 
getShortMessages. The getShortMessages function takes an array of objects with '.message' properties and returns 
an array of messages that are less than < 50 characters long. The function should also return an array containing 
the messages themselves, without their containing object. Ther is some boilerplate code attached that we must use
and we are told not to use unnecessary loops etc and to try using chaining array methods. The solution should look
like this

module.exports = function getShortMessages(messages){
      var messageFilter = messages.filter(function(msg){
            if(msg.message && msg.message.length < 50){
                  return messages;
            }
      });
      
      return messageFilter.map(function(msg){
            return msg.message;
      });
};

I had to get some help with this as I was not returning properly in the map function, I was returning messages when
is should have been the singular.
