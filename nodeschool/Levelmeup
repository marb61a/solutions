These are my solutions to the levelmeup set of challenges from Nodeschool

Level 1 -
This is the first challenge of the series and as to be expected it is a fairly basic one to get going with. The task
according to the documentation is to -
Write a Node program that accepts two command-line arguments, X and
Y and prints out to the console the following text:

  ALL YOUR X ARE BELONG TO Y
  
There are a few solutions but mine is
var x = process.argv[2];
var y = process.argv[3];

console.log("ALL YOUR " + x + " ARE BELONG TO " + y);
