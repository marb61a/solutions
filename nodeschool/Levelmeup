These are my solutions to the levelmeup set of challenges from Nodeschool

Level 1 - All Your base
This is the first challenge of the series and as to be expected it is a fairly basic one to get going with. The task
according to the documentation is to -
Write a Node program that accepts two command-line arguments, X and
Y and prints out to the console the following text:

  ALL YOUR X ARE BELONG TO Y
  
There are a few solutions but mine is
var x = process.argv[2];
var y = process.argv[3];

console.log("ALL YOUR " + x + " ARE BELONG TO " + y);



Level 2 - Get Your Level On
This is the second level in the series and according to the documentation the task is -
Write a program that opens a `level` directory and reads a key from it.

Your program should take two arguments, a LevelDB directory, and a key.
your program should then retrive the value of that key, and write it to the console.

for example, if `database_dir` contains a record `foo => bar` then the command
`node levelread.js database_dir foo` should output `bar`.

The hints section gives pretty much the whole solution apart from a few minor changes, so the solution should 
look like this -

var level = require("level");
var x = process.argv[2];
var db = level(x);

db.get('levelmeup', function(err, value){
    console.log(value);
});

As can be seen it it a fairly quick solution after using the boilerplate sample code from the hints.
