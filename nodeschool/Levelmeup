These are my solutions to the levelmeup set of challenges from Nodeschool

Level 1 - All Your base
This is the first challenge of the series and as to be expected it is a fairly basic one to get going with. The task
according to the documentation is to -
Write a Node program that accepts two command-line arguments, X and
Y and prints out to the console the following text:

  ALL YOUR X ARE BELONG TO Y
  
There are a few solutions but mine is
var x = process.argv[2];
var y = process.argv[3];

console.log("ALL YOUR " + x + " ARE BELONG TO " + y);



Level 2 - Get Your Level On
This is the second level in the series and according to the documentation the task is -
Write a program that opens a `level` directory and reads a key from it.

Your program should take two arguments, a LevelDB directory, and a key.
your program should then retrive the value of that key, and write it to the console.

for example, if `database_dir` contains a record `foo => bar` then the command
`node levelread.js database_dir foo` should output `bar`.

The hints section gives pretty much the whole solution apart from a few minor changes, so the solution should 
look like this -

var level = require("level");
var x = process.argv[2];
var db = level(x);

db.get('levelmeup', function(err, value){
    console.log(value);
});

As can be seen it it a fairly quick solution after using the boilerplate sample code from the hints.



Level 3 - GET Basics
The task in the third challenge is to -
Write a program that opens a LevelDB data-store using `level`.

The store will contain up to 10 entries with keys in the form:

  keyX

Where 'X' is an integer between 0 and 100.

You must find those entries and print them out to the console, ordered
by 'X', ascending. You should print them out with:

  console.log(key + '=' + value)
  // will output "key12=here is that random text"

The full path to the data-store will be provided to your program as
the first command-line argument.

There are plenty of hints given so the challenge should be relatively straightforward and should look like this -

var level = require("level");
var x = process.argv[2];
var db = level(x);

for (var i = 0; i < 101; i++) {
  (function (currKey) {
    db.get(currKey, function (err, data) {
      if (err && err.notFound) {
        return;
      }

      console.log("%s=%s", currKey, data);
    });
  }("key" + i));
}

I did spend a lot of time testting various combinations of solutions but this is the quickest, the official 
solution is well worth looking at.
