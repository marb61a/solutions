These are my solutions to the Nodeschool Expressworks exercises.

Level 1 Hello World -
The first exercise is as always an easy on we are asked to create an Express.js app that outputs "Hello World!" when 
somebody goes to /home. Also there are a couple of directions given, the port number will be provided to you by 
expressworks as the first argument of the application, ie. process.argv[2]. We are also asked to please use 
process.argv[2] instead of a fixed port number. There is a lot of sample code given so that will be what we will use. 
The solution is this -

var express = require('express');
var app = express();
var portNum = process.argv[2];

app.get('/home', function(req, res) {
      res.end('Hello World!');
    });
app.listen(portNum);

As you can see ther was not much to add to the sample code other than changing root to home and like in other sets of
challenges I assign the port number to its own variable which is not really necessary.
