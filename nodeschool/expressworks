These are my solutions to the Nodeschool Expressworks exercises.

Level 1 Hello World -
The first exercise is as always an easy on we are asked to create an Express.js app that outputs "Hello World!" when 
somebody goes to /home. Also there are a couple of directions given, the port number will be provided to you by 
expressworks as the first argument of the application, ie. process.argv[2]. We are also asked to please use 
process.argv[2] instead of a fixed port number. There is a lot of sample code given so that will be what we will use. 
The solution is this -

var express = require('express');
var app = express();
var portNum = process.argv[2];

app.get('/home', function(req, res) {
      res.end('Hello World!');
    });
app.listen(portNum);

As you can see there was not much to add to the sample code other than changing root to home and like in other sets of
challenges I assign the port number to its own variable which is not really necessary.



Level 2  Static -
In this challenge we are asked to apply static middleware to serve an index.html file without any routes. The
solution must listen on the port number supplied by process.argv[2]. The index.html file is provided and usable via 
the path supplied by process.argv[3]. There are hints on how to do this and the solution should be straightforward
enough -

var express = require('express');
var portNum = process.argv[2];
var filePath = process.argv[3];
var app = express();

app.use(express.static(filePath || filePath.join(__dirname, 'public')));
app.listen(portNum);

This is my solution but there are others.



Level 3 Jade -
In this the third challenge we are asked to create an Express.js app with a home page rendered by Jade template 
engine. The homepage should respond to /home and the view should show the current date using toDateString. There is
a lot of sample code given and this should make the challenge easier to complete. The solution is

var express = require('express');
var portNum = process.argv[2];
var filePath = process.argv[3];
var app = express();
app.set('view engine', 'jade');
app.set('views', filePath || filePath.join(__dirname, 'public'));

app.get('/home', function(req, res) {
    res.render('index', {date: new Date().toDateString()});
});

app.listen(portNum);

As you cann see there is a lot of previously used code along with the documentation hints.
