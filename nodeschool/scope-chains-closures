                The scope-chains-closures series of challenges
  
Level 1 Scopes -
This level has a lot of notes on the various scopes available within javascript, the challenge itself is fairly
basic as the solution will show -

function foo (){
  var bar;  
};




Level 2 Scope Chains -
This is an extension of the previous level -
Modify your solution from lesson 1 so foo contains a function zip
which itself contains one variable lexically scoped called quux

The solution again is very easy -

function foo (){
    function zip(){
        var quux
    }
  var bar;  
};




Level 3 Global Scope and Shadowing
The third task is again an extension of the previous challenge -
Starting with your solution from the previous lesson, assign a value to quux
inside foo() (don't use var or let). The value should be different to the
value assigned when defining quux inside zip().
In spit of the lengthy discussion the solution is relatively straightforward - 

function foo (){
    quux = 0;
    function zip(){
        var quux
    }
  var bar;  
};
