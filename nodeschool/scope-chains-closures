                The scope-chains-closures series of challenges
  
Level 1 Scopes -
This level has a lot of notes on the various scopes available within javascript, the challenge itself is fairly
basic as the solution will show -

function foo (){
  var bar;  
};




Level 2 Scope Chains -
This is an extension of the previous level -
Modify your solution from lesson 1 so foo contains a function zip
which itself contains one variable lexically scoped called quux

The solution again is very easy -

function foo (){
    function zip(){
        var quux
    }
  var bar;  
};
