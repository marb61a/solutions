This is the Nodeschool Promise It Won't Hurt set of challenges and the solutions. It is designed to help you use
promises to handle async operations.

Level 01  Fullfill a Promise -
This is the first challenge in this series and in it you are asked to use the "Q" library to create a promise. After  
that you will need to pass console.log to the "then" method of your promise. Then manually resolve that promise using 
setTimeout with a delay of 300ms and pass it a parameter of "RESOLVED!". There is boiler plate code included and as is
standard the challenge should be fairly basic. The solution is 

var q = require('q');
var defer = q.defer();

defer.promise.then(console.log);
setTimeout(defer.resolve, 300, "RESOLVED!");

Make sure that everything is in the correct order and you have included the exclamation mark as that will cause a 
failure.
