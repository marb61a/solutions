These ar my solutions to the Regex Adventure series of challenges

Level 1 Literally - 
This is the first of the challenges of the series and as usual it is very easy as usual -
For our first adventure, create a new file that will receive a string as an
argument and should return whether the string contains another string,
"LITERALLY".
There are also plenty of hints and boilerplate that can be used so the solution is fairly obvious -

module.exports = function(str){
   return /LITERALLY/.test(str);
};

Anything surrounded by the forward slashes is regarded as a regular expression.
