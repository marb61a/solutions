These are the solutions to the Learnyoumongo challenges

You may have to create the data directory.

    mkdir data

To start mongo on port 27017, run mongod --port 27017 --dbpath=./data.

Then, in another terminal, run npm install mongodb.

Then, run learnyoumongo verify.

If this lesson is passed, be sure to leave mongod running as it will
be used for the remainder of the exercise.

I am using cloud9.io an online IDE and the instructions for installing mongodb are here -
https://docs.c9.io/docs/setting-up-mongodb.
Following all of these and running mongodb ensures success.
