1 Hello World - 
Make a file,
add console.log('HELLO WORLD') and save
Run the file using node filename and verify.

2 Baby Steps - 
Several ways are available to do this but using a loop is easiest,
as before have a file made and opened, my solution is similar to the 
official one which opens when completed. This is the official completion
var result = 0

for (var i = 2; i < process.argv.length; i++)
  result += Number(process.argv[i])

console.log(result)

******* There are other solutions involving slice which should be investigated.
