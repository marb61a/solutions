To get started with learnyounode, install using

npm install -g learnyounode

1 Hello World - 
Make a file,
add console.log('HELLO WORLD') and save
Run the file using node filename and verify.


2 Baby Steps - 
Several ways are available to do this but using a loop is easiest,
as before have a file made and opened, my solution is similar to the 
official one which opens when completed. This is the official completion
var result = 0

for (var i = 2; i < process.argv.length; i++)
  result += Number(process.argv[i])

console.log(result)

******* There are other solutions involving slice which should be investigated.



3 My First IO - 
Like before there are several solutions but the are parameters which must be followed 
- fs module is required to be able to perform filesystem operations.
- readFileSync is also needed as all fs module ops which are synchronous end with sync.
The solution is - 
var fs = require("fs");

var filename = process.argv[2];

var contents = fs.readFileSync(filename).toString();

console.log(contents.split('\n').length - 1);

where you have included the fs module, taken in the file, converted to string and then split 
and sent to the console. The process.argv has a 2 because the test file is located as the third
item and arrays are zero indexed. This can be checked by passing the process.argv to the console.
