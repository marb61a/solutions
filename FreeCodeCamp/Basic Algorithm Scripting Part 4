Sum All Odd Fibonacci Numbers -
The task involved in this challenge is -
Return the sum of all odd Fibonacci numbers up to and including the passed number if it is a Fibonacci number.
The first few numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8, and each subsequent number is the sum of the 
previous two numbers.
As an example, passing 4 to the function should return 5 because all the odd Fibonacci numbers under 4 are 1, 1, 
and 3. This is the solution from another site as my solution which was similar was lost due to a freeze on the site

function sumFibs(num) {
  var i = 1;
  var j = 2;
  var k = 0;
  var sum = 2;
  while (k < num ) {
      if (k % 2 === 1) {
          sum = sum + k;
      }
      k = i + j;
      i = j;
      j = k;
  }
  return sum;
}

sumFibs(4);
