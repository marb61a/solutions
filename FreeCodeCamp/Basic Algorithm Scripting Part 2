This is Part 2 of my solutions to the FreeCodeCamp challenges. Like before these are not in the order they appear on
the site.



Roman Numeral Converter - I had to look this up online and although there are variations on a theme most revolve
around the same solution

function convert(num) {
 var conversionSet = {M:1000,CM:900,D:500,CD:400,C:100,XC:90,L:50,XL:40,X:10,IX:9,V:5,IV:4,I:1};
 var romanNumerals = '';
 var i;
  
 for(i in conversionSet){
   while( num >= conversionSet[i]){
     romanNumerals += i;
     num -= conversionSet[i];
   }
 } 
 return romanNumerals;
}

convert(36);

The solutions I came across all had similar methods as above. Basically you can do it like this or have a list or
dictionary with keys and values. Then there needs to be a couple of loops one to check the entered number against the
list of values. The second loop will run the number through conversion, it will be easier to demonstrate.
    36 is entered
    40 is too big so 10 is chosen
    10 is subtracted so it is now 26 which means that this needs to be repeated twice more
    6 is then left and 5 is subtracted
    1 is left
    Because the romanNumeral variable was empty it has the values from the conversionSet added, this is then
    sent to the screen and should be XXXVI
As I said previously there are many solutions available and the freecodecamp site suggests using various array
methods but of all the possible solutions I read and tried this one made the most sense to me and full credit goes
to the guys whose solutions helped me with this.
