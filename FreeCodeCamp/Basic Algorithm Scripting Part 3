This is part 3 of my solutions to the Basic Algorithm Scripting bonfires on freecodecamp

Seek and Destroy - 
The challenge here according to the site is the following -
You will be provided with an initial array (the first argument in the destroyer function), followed by one or more 
arguments. Remove all elements from the initial array that are of the same value as these arguments.
The solution itself is relatively simple but like always there are multiple way to do the same thing

function destroyer(arr) {
  
  var args = [].slice.call(arguments, 0);
  var array = [];
  var secondArray = args.shift();
  
  secondArray.forEach(function(val){
    if(args.indexOf(val) < 0){
      array.push(val);
    }
  });
  
  return array;
}

destroyer([1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3], 2, 3);

I have looked at some other solutions that involve filter but as I am more familiar with the simpler methods I will
stick with them.
